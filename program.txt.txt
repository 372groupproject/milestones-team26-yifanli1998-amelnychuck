This is a plan for our program in CSc372.

We plan to implement a image or several images, which can be read as matrix in matlab.
We expect the program have the functions that change the RBG value of the image,edit the image matrix, maybe we can transfer a image from 3D to 2D.
we expect the program going to be about 200 lines code.
We think this program will be a good illustration of the language our matlab since only matlab can deal matrix in such a convenient way, not other languages can do this.
Our program shows how interesting can handling matrix in matlab.
