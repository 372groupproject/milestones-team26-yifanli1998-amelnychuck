The general theme of the video is show how our program can change the image.
THe idea is we change the matrix of input image to change the RGB value of the matrix, then change the figure.
I want to show the code which can blurry the image.
I will change the style of several image and dim some intesting image.
We have not determine the specific way to shoot it, but I think the PowerPoint is a better choice. We will show how the program influence the image.
